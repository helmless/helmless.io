# What is Helmless?

!!! warning "Page under construction"

    🚧 This page is under construction. 🚧

Helmless is an open-source project that brings the power and simplicity of Helm to serverless deployments. It provides a familiar GitOps workflow for deploying containerized applications to serverless platforms like Google Cloud Run, without the complexity of Kubernetes or the verbosity of Terraform.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Helm-Based Deployments

Helmless uses Helm charts as the foundation for deployments, providing:

- **Familiar templating** - Use the same Helm syntax you already know
- **Value overrides** - Manage environment-specific configurations
- **Version control** - Track changes and rollback deployments
- **Package management** - Share and reuse deployment configurations

### 2. Direct Serverless Integration

Unlike traditional Helm charts that target Kubernetes, Helmless:

- Templates charts directly into cloud provider configurations
- Deploys using native cloud provider CLIs
- Bypasses the need for a Kubernetes cluster
- Maintains cloud-native best practices

### 3. GitOps Workflow

Helmless embraces GitOps principles by:

- Storing configuration as code
- Automating deployments through CI/CD
- Providing audit trails through Git history
- Enabling collaboration through pull requests

## How It Works

At its core, Helmless follows a simple workflow:

    A[Helm Chart] --> B[Template Action]
    B --> C[Cloud Provider
    Manifest]
    C --> D[Deploy Action]
    D --> E[Serverless
    Platform]
```

1. **Template**: Convert Helm charts to cloud provider configurations
2. **Validate**: Ensure configurations meet platform requirements
3. **Deploy**: Use cloud provider CLIs for direct deployment
4. **Monitor**: Track deployment status and health
## Key Components

Helmless consists of several specialized components:

### Charts

Cloud provider-specific Helm charts that define your application deployment:



### Actions

GitHub Actions that handle templating and deployment:

### Infrastructure Modules

Supporting infrastructure components:
